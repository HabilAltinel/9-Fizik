### Ingredients:
- 1/3 cup joshinko, rice flour
- 1/3 cup shiratamako/mochiko, sweet rice /glutinous rice flour
- 2 tablespoons sugar
- 3/4 cup hot water
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 tbsp. soy sauce
- 1/2 tbsp. katakuriko starch or cornstarch, mixed with 1 1/2 tbsp. of water
- 5 bamboo skewers

### Steps to Make It
Gather the ingredients.

Combine shiratamako, joshinko, and sugar in a bowl.

Gradually pour 3/4 cup hot water over the combination. Stir in hot water a little bit a time and knead slowly until the dough becomes smooth. The texture is like squeezing an "earlobe." Feel free to mix it using a spatula until combined.

Knead the dough with hands until smooth.

Divide the dough into small pieces and roll into small balls.

Place the dumplings in a preheated steamer and steam them on high heat for about 10 minutes.

Cool the dumplings and put dumplings on skewers. (3 or 4 dumplings for a skewer)

To make the mitarashi sauce, mix water, sugar, and soy sauce in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat.

Pour the katakuriko starch mixture into the sauce, stirring well. Bring to a boil again and stop the heat.

Grill the skewered dumplings until slightly grill-marked.

Brush the mitarashi sauce over dumplings.
